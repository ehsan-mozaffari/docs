## Liver shots

Best person who can execute best massive liver shots is **Naoya Inoue**.

Here are his techniques to execute livershots:

* Jab to the face + Cross to the face + Drop left arm and then execute the left lower hook with his maximum heap spin (cause to expose the chin and afterward he always have head movement)
* Fake faint after a lots of head combination and when he lift his arm up put his lead foot forward and execute Liver Shot
* To have more spin he always balance himself with a cross, right hook or faint and then execute the left for the liver shot
* His Liver Shot punches follow through meaning that it doesn't stop after the hit and move forward. It can cause the massive power into punches.
* Full spin with hip and shoulder and arm following at the last second
* Have the right arm protect his face tapped in his forehead
