# Be Masculine

Being high value as a man to be successful specially with women.


## When to leave a woman

* When she said "Let's be friend"
* You don't smash her after maximum 3 dates
* A girl that doesn't have female friends and just guy friends (belogs to the street)
* If a girl put you in a friend zone it is an ultimate disrespect to you
*
